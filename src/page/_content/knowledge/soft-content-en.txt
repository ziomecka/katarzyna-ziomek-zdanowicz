I have gained extensive knowledge and have become familiar with wide range of frameworks, libraries and tools commonly used in the modern frontend development. I also did my best to develop skills that I consider important in the work of a developer.
I'm still learning because my goal is to become an outstanding programmer. As a next step, I plan to dive into the world of algorithms, data structures and design patterns.
I dream of learning another programming language. I think of Kotlin or Python. The choice is still ahead of me.
